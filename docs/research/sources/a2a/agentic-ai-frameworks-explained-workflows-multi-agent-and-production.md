Hi, let me guess. The world around you is abuzz with agentic 
AI systems and their massive potential. So you decide to go off and 
build an agentic system. You look for the best 
available framework out there. And now, all of a sudden, 
you have 17 GitHub tabs open, five medium blocks bookmarked, and you 
are still clueless on how to proceed. Yes, we've all been there. LangChain, LangGraph, Crew AI, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel. There are so many powerful frameworks 
out there, but which one would you pick?

And in order to answer that question, you first need to understand which type 
of agentic AI system you want to build. In this video, we are going to cover five types 
of most common agent AI projects or systems. We are going discuss an example for 
each of those and also list frameworks which are best suited for those types 
of agentic AI systems and projects. First, let's get some basics out of the way. What exactly is an agentic AI framework?

An agentic framework is a toolkit 
for building agentic AI systems. Let's understand with an example. Let's say you have an agent 
to analyze some sales data. This agent goes to a database 
and extracts the relevant data. It analyzes the data, maybe 
runs some calculations, and then generates a report and crafts a response 
that can be sent to the concerned person. Now, there's a lot going on here, and 
there's lot of coordination that's needed. And it gets even more complex when 
you have multiple agents working.

And that's exactly why you 
need an agentic AI framework. The framework is like a building block. Unlike a chatbot application where you 
just ask a question and get an answer, the agentic system actually does a lot 
of planning, acting, and iterating.

It is because of this complexity involved 
that we need an agentic AI framework. These are like building blocks that help 
us deploy and manage agentic AI systems. Now these have some predefined functions that help us build agentic AI systems with more ease and 
agility, such as we have predefined architectures.

We might have integration and monitoring tools.

We might also have some task 
management capabilities.

And communication protocols.

Together, these features and functionalities 
give agentic AI frameworks the capability to allow us to build these systems with ease. Like we discussed before, there are multiple 
agentic frameworks available out there, but they're not all competing 
to do the same type of tasks. In fact, they're optimized for 
different types of agentic AI systems. Most agentic AI systems and projects we are working 
on today fall into one of the five categories. First, we have linear workflows. We have autonomous AI agents or 
autonomous multi-agent systems.

We have role-based AI systems, 
production orchestration systems, and then we have rapid prototyping. Let's dive in and understand 
each of these in more detail. Let's start with the simplest 
one, linear workflows. Now, this type of an agentic AI system is where 
things progress in a step-by-step fashion. It is more predictable what's gonna happen next.

And the steps follow a certain sequence.

For example, consider a customer-facing 
application, let's say a customer support agent. The role of this agent is when a user asks a 
question, the agent is going to take the question and search the knowledge 
base for relevant responses. It's then going to craft a response 
and send it back to the user and maybe take an additional action 
such as creating a support ticket. Now, if you observe, these steps are progressing 
in a certain fashion, in a certainly sequence, and these systems are more useful when 
you need the flows to be more reliable.

There isn't a need for multiple agents 
to collaborate to make this happen. And that gives you more 
control on how things progress.

A good example of frameworks that are suitable 
for this kind of a setup include LangChain.

And  LlamaIndex.

LangChain is more suited for setups where multiple 
steps need to be happening in a certain sequence. LlamaIndex is highly suitable for heavy applications that are heavy 
on the data retrieval and indexing. For more complex setups, you could also 
use LangGraph, which is also by LangChain. Next, we have the autonomous agentic AI systems. In these systems, you typically give AI a goal.

And have it figure out how to accomplish it. So in this system, it's very common to see 
multiple agents collaborating together.

These agents talk to each other 
to accomplish the common goal. A good example of this could 
be an AI coding assistant. You could have a planner agent 
that plans the solution for you. You could a coder agent that 
actually writes the code for you, and a reviewer agent, that is reviewing the code, making recommendations, and 
also helping with the debugging. These agents are constantly talking to each other 
in order to give the best code possible to you.

So, in this kind of setup, the 
problem is usually open ended. And that's the kind of problems this 
kind of setup is most helpful for.

So, frameworks that work best for this 
kind of a scenario include AutoGen.

You could also use experimental 
setups like Baby AGI.

And CrewAI could also be helpful for designing these kind of 
systems where problems are open-ended and multiple agents are collaborating 
together to achieve a shared goal. Next, we have the role-based agentic AI systems. These are kind of similar to 
the autonomous agentic systems where there are multiple agents collaborating. So it is also a multi-agent setup.

But what makes it different is that each 
agent within the setup has a defined role.

They are still communicating with 
each other to accomplish that goal, but they are operating within the confines or 
the constraints posed by their role descriptions. They are working together, 
but with clear boundaries. A good example of this could 
be a content generation agent. Here, you could have a researcher 
agent that goes on the web and fetches all the material that's needed 
to write a piece of content. There could be writer agent 
that looks at all the content that has been fetched and writes up an article.

That goes out on a social 
media website, let's say. And then there could be an editor 
agent that's looking at the article that has been written and make some edits to it. Now, they have very clearly 
defined roles and they don't go into other agents roles when they do this. They have discussions, but 
they're strictly confined to the description that has given 
to them for their particular roles. A good framework that is 
applicable here is CrewAI.

But you could also use AutoGen 
with some structures around it for this kind of an agentic AI systems. There are also some niche frameworks that 
are applicable to very specific tasks. Like, for example, for software development 
kind of tasks, you have ChatDev.

So these are the kind of frameworks that you 
would use for role-based agentic AI systems. Next up, we have the production 
orchestration systems. Like the name suggests, this is when AI 
moves out of the experimentation phase and gets real or moves into a real-world system. These kind of systems require 
deep integration with APIs,

databases, and business workflows.

Consider the example of an AI operations agent. This agent detects alerts, searches 
the documentation for the alerts, and then runs some automation scripts and sends summaries in a real world 
scenario within an organization. Good examples of frameworks that are 
suitable for this kind of an AI system, include agent framework,

which essentially is a combination 
of semantic kernel and autogen. Another good example here is LangGraph.

Which works for well-structured, 
multilayered applications. Ancient framework is suitable both for 
orchestration as well as for running autonomous workflows. Last but not least, you 
have the rapid prototyping. So you always don't need a perfect architecture. You just need to check if 
your idea would work or not. These types of systems are best when 
you need to quickly validate ideas. It helps you build quick prototypes. To see if you can bring your ideas to reality. These kind of systems are where you ideally have 
a user interface where you can drag components and bring them onto a canvas to 
build quick workflows and test ideas.

Examples of tools or frameworks that 
are useful here include LangFlow.

And Flowise.

These tools offer you a good graphical user interface where you can 
bring components onto a canvas and connect models and workflows 
and quickly test out your ideas that you can later on take into production. These are very quick for rapid 
prototyping and hence the name. So when choosing a framework, do 
not ask which framework is the best. Instead ask what kind of 
system am I trying to build? If it's predictable, use a workflow approach. If it is exploratory, use the autonomous agents.

If it needs teamwork, use role-based systems. If it's going into production, use the 
production orchestration frameworks. And if you are testing ideas, 
use the rapid prototyping tools. Because the right framework depends 
on whether you're building a pipeline, a team of agents, or a production AI system. Which agentic AI framework is your typical go-to? Feel free to comment below and
