Most people try to fix bad. BI Answers by writing
bigger prompts. That's a wrong move. If you have been padding prompts
like an essay to make your model give you better answers than
stick around in a few minutes, you'll learn how to use context
engineering in a simple way to make your AI systems
smarter and way more reliable. By the end of this video,
you'll know exactly what context engineering is, why it's
different from just prompting and a step by step way to
use it on real projects.

We'll road test it on a
tiny but realistic agent, show you where context
usually fall apart, and give you a checklist on
how to fix them really fast. Context engineering is the
craft of deciding exactly what the model should see
and what it shouldn't. At each step, it includes
your system, message tools, retrieved facts,
short term notes. Long term memories. Format rules and
also recent history. If prompt engineering
is how you word the ask, then context engineering
is everything.

You feed the model so it
can actually do the job. This is a huge shift that
AI teams across the industry are calling out where we are
moving from perfect prompts to curating the smallest
set of high signal tokens that steer the behavior of your
model into the right direction, especially in agents that run
for many turns and use tools. So now context is being treated
like a scarce working memory, and AI developers are
looking at it differently.

Why does this matter. So models keep getting
larger context Windows, but longer context
isn't always better. When you fill up that
window, accuracy often drops because errors sneak in
and the model gets distracted by stale or irrelevant text
or two pieces of context which actually quietly
contradict each other. This shows up most in agents,
where the conversation and tools output snowballs, so you'll
see four common failure modes in the wild. First off, we have poisoning,
where a hallucinated fact gets into context and is
reused over and over again.

Second, we have something
called distraction, where the model fixates
on a huge history instead of making a fresh plan. Third is confusion, where extra
unrelated details nudge it into the wrong answer. And fourth is clash,
where two sources disagree and the model picks
the wrong one. So why am I mentioning this
because knowing these names can help you fix what is wrong. Next, we need to talk about
what the difference is between context engineering
versus prompt engineering.

So prompt engineering
is how you write and structure instructions
examples and constraints. It's still very relevant. And useful, but
context engineering is how you assemble
everything that the model will see at runtime, like the
right tools, the right facts, the right history,
and the right format. It's dynamic and happens
before every model call. So it's pretty powerful. Think of the model like a
brain with a limited short term memory. Your job is to pack
it with all the things that it needs for the next step.

And you have limited
space to do so. Here is what is in a context
stack currently for most models that we use. There are seven pieces involved. First, we have
instructions, which are the system prompt
and guardrails. Clear and plain
language wins here. Second, we have
user input, which is the current ask from the user. Third, we have retrieved facts
which are the few snippets that matter the most. Fourth, we have tools which are
functions that the model can call as well as their
descriptions, which are part of the context.

Fifth, we have short
term notes which summarizes all the recent steps
so that the model remembers what has changed recently. Sixth, we have long
term memory, which contains stable facts about
the user or project selected on demand. And lastly, we
have output format, which are schemas
or examples that lock the shape of the answer. Now let's dive into
a single example. Let's build a
simple agent called log look, which is a helper that
three Azure security alerts when they occur, and drafts a one
paragraph summary of the alert, plus a severity score of
how severe the alert is.

The chatbot way is to
say, hey, here you go. Analyze today's logs and
tell me what's wrong. It might actually just spit out
random guesses at that point, but with context engineering,
we feed log look our agent a clean plate of the
following things. First, we give system
instructions summarize incidents into one paragraph plus a
severity score between 0 and 4. Only use provided context
and if missing data exists, ask for a specific file path. Second, we will
list tools that it requires in order to answer
the questions that we ask it.

So for example,
reading file or grep or get known false positives. Third, we provide retrieved
facts which only contain today's log slice, and
only lines with error or critical from the last
hour will be sent to our agent and also the team's false
positive list for noisy alerts is something that we will
also flag to our agent. The fourth thing that we're
going to be passing to our agent is short term notes. So we've already
checked this file.

Next scan this log instead. And then we're also going
to be giving it a format. We want it to expect JSON
formats input and output. So that's the difference. Same model but with
way better context. Now let's talk about the four
steps of context engineering. These show up across
the best agent systems. And they're really
simple to remember right. Select compress and isolate. First we have write
which means to save notes outside of the context window.

This actually lets
the agent keep a scratchpad which contains
plans, intermediate results, and open questions. It also makes sure that we
don't squeeze all of that into the next call, but
instead keep it external and only pull from it
when it's relevant. This keeps the working context
clean while preserving memory. So for our agent log look,
we can store all of that into something called
investigation steps, which will contain a bulleted
list of what's been checked.

Second step is select,
which means pull only what matters right now. So use retrieval to fetch
just the log slices and policy lines needed for this turn. Hybrid retrieval, which contains
both keyword and semantics, often beats embedding
only search on messy logs. The point is selection
and not hoarding. So for our agent log look,
we'll be selecting the top n number of error bursts
and the specific section on severity scoring
from our runbook. And the third step we
have compress, which means keep the signal
but drop the rest.

What we need to do is
periodically summarize long histories into
short loss aware nodes, and then continue
with a fresh window. So this keeps the last
few raw items for safety, but then it also beats dragging
a huge chat history everywhere. So for log look we'll be
keeping the last five findings, but everything older will be
rolled into a three line recap. The fourth and final
step is isolate, which means sandbox
sources to avoid crosstalk. We can do this by splitting big
jobs into subagents or phases.

Each explores its own context
and then returns a short digest to a coordinator. This reduces leakage
between tools and prevents one noisy source
from poisoning the rest. So for our agent log look,
a reader subagent just extracts the facts, and
then a score or agent applies the policy
while a writer agent composes the final
summary from their digests. If you remember one
thing from all of this, it's really important to curate. Instead of dumping a
large chunk of prompts.

Context engineering
isn't just a buzzword, it's the natural progression
of prompt engineering. It's a discipline of building
robust, reliable, and truly useful applications. It's how we move
from simple chatbots to complex AI agents that
can become our collaborators. Hope you found this video
helpful and hope you've learned how context
engineering actually works and how it differs from
something prompt engineering.
