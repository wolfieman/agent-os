By themselves, AI agents are kind of isolated. 
Yeah. Right. They can reason by themselves. They can generate stuff by themselves. But how does 
one agent talk to another agent or talk to your existing infrastructure? That's where it can get 
messy. Lots of custom integrations to things like data stores or code bases. Yeah. Yeah. And look, 
the the industry knows this is a problem. So, naturally, we got protocols. A2A, MCP. Maybe 
you've seen these acronyms floating around.

And maybe you're wondering how they can be used 
to help agents and which one you're supposed to use. Well, look, I'm a bit of an advocate for 
MCP, so I'll take that one. But first, Anna, convince me why I need A2A in my life. If you're 
doing anything with multi-agent orchestration, you should absolutely consider A2A Martin. 
A2A is short for agent to agent protocol. So essentially siloed agents can communicate and 
work together regardless of differing vendors or frameworks. Okay. So whether you or 
I or somebody else built the agents, does that mean they can they can still work 
together? Exactly. It's an open protocol that defines how AI agents can exchange messages 
and task requests between each other. And these messages can be requests, responses, and even 
negotiation or coordination steps. All right, fair enough. But but how do these agents know how 
to collaborate with the other agents here? Like, do they have a digital name tag or something? 
Actually, yeah, kind of. With A2A, agents use something called an agent card. Essentially, a 
standardized descriptor to advertise what they can do. Okay. An agent card. That's a a fancy name for 
a resume. Yeah, exactly. Other agents can discover these cards dynamically and figure out what 
skills or services are offered and decide, hey, you do that, I'll do this. and pass tasks back and 
forth. Okay, that's that's pretty elegant, but but my agent here, it still needs to talk to my to my 
database. So, is A2A .. A2A going to do that for me?

It's not really what A2A is for. All right. Noted. 
We'll we'll come back to you, Mr. Database. Um, but another question for you. So, if I've got a 
variety of different agents and they use different modalities. So let's say this agent here, this is 
primarily a text modality agent. Maybe this one primarily works with images. Can they understand 
each other or would it be like us trying to speak two different languages? So that's actually 
another plus of using A2A. Once discovered, agents can send structured messages or task requests to 
each other. And these exchanges in in information are modality agnostic, meaning agents can swap 
images, files, structured data, not just text. And if you have one agent generate a design mockup, 
another agent can review it, and another can uh be a client approval agent. All part of the same 
flow. All right. And then how do these two agents, you got this arrow here, how do they communicate? 
What's the the transport layer? It's just plain old HTTP. So any existing web server, API gateway, 
or infrastructure that speaks HTTP can host an A2A agent just like a normal web service. But 
the magic is really in the data format and communication style. And whenever I hear the word 
magic in text, it's usually followed by a bunch of acronyms. Indeed, it is. And here's one for you. 
A2A uses JSON RPC 2.0 for request and response payloads. That means agent to agent communication 
happens via structured JSON which is language agnostic and widely supported. Nice. So you're 
getting the benefits of web infrastructure like I guess routing, security layers, load balancing, 
logging, that sort of stuff. And because A2A is building on standard HTTP and the magic of JSON 
RPC, it integrates easily with existing backend stacks. I'll admit the transport layer story is 
pretty clean. Starting to come around. I mean, I'm listening. I'm listening. Well, how about this? 
A2A isn't just for quick call and response tasks.

You'll like this one, Martin. For long running jobs 
or workflows where agents need to send progressive updates, A2A supports streaming updates via 
server sent events. That means one agent can push status updates and partial results to another 
in near real time. Meaning that remote agents can send back intermediary progress while they work. 
This live streamed progress updates, which seems useful. Just useful, Martin. very useful. But but 
that still leaves the question of how a single agent gets context which conveniently is what MCP 
handles. Convenient indeed. All right, convince me. It'll be my pleasure. So A2A handles agent to 
agent communication. But what happens when we've just got a standalone individual agent that needs 
access to external data or tools? Well, MCP is what happens at least if you want to provide a way 
that access is done in a standardized way. And MCP is model context protocol? Model context protocol. 
Giving a single agent the context it needs to actually do useful work. And that might be work 
like pulling a file out of a file system. It might be work like interacting with an existing code 
repository. It might be something like writing to a database. Well, Martin, couldn't I just 
write code to do all these things? Yeah, you sure could. And you'd be writing it again and again 
because you'd have to write it every time you swap models or every time you swap tools. Okay, I 
I'm listening. All right. So, look, MCP creates a layer and that layer is where the AI agent doesn't 
need to know the specifics about how to interact with any of these resources here. There's a a 
really simple infrastructure around this. Ah, I sense some boxes and lines are incoming. Yeah, 
you do. Okay. So, we've got uh first box is an MCP host. Uh this is the AI application where the 
agent actually runs. And then below that we've got the actual MCP server. And the MCP server knows 
how to communicate to these resources like the file system or the code repo or the database. But 
it does so while presenting a uniform interface to the agent. A uniform interface how exactly? Like 
if my agent wants to retrieve a file from the file system or wants to edit a line of code in the 
repo, what does it do? Yeah, it it uses primitives that are exposed by this guy, the MCP server. 
So there's a bunch. You've got tools. Now, these functions are things that the model can invoke. 
So it could be a tool to, for example, search the database or commit something to the code repo. 
Uh there are also resources and these are things that the model can read like files or database 
records or maybe maybe live application state.

And then the third primitive are prompts. So these 
are basically pre-built templates that help the model interact and that serve more efficiency. 
Okay. So the agent doesn't need to know how the database is implemented or which API works best 
with the local file system. It just kind of passes the request to the primitives exposed by the MCP 
server and it handles translation. That makes a lot of sense. Well, thank you. Well, in theory 
at least. But in practice, how does the MCP host communicate with the MCP server? Yeah. Okay. So 
like A2A the message format is JSON RPC but the transport actually that depends it depends 
on where the server lives. So for local servers that are running on the the same machine let's 
say like maybe a an IDE plugin that's accessing your local file system. Well it uses just standard 
input output for that. But if we are talking about something that is you know not on your machine a 
remote server that is a different kettle of fish instead that uses HTTP with its streaming support. 
Okay. So you write an MCP server once let's say for a CRM system and any MCP compatible host 
can use it. And what happens when you bring in a new model or a new application? Yeah it doesn't 
doesn't matter. you're you're not rebuilding the integration every time. Just reuse the same MCP 
server. And because it's open, there are a ton of pre-made MCP servers. There's an MCP server for 
all sorts of file systems, for Slack, for GitHub, for databases, and so on. So, I think we've both 
made our case for why A2A and MCP can be useful.

So how about we consider a scenario where both A2A 
and MCP can be used together. Right? So perhaps let's do an example of a a retail store. So we 
have got our own inventory agent here and that inventory agent is going to use MCP to interact 
with some databases. So, it's going to use that to store and retrieve information about perhaps 
products, uh, about stock levels as well. And if the inventory agent detects products low in 
stock, it notifies an internal order agent, which then communicates with external supplier agents. 
So, maybe you have one or maybe you have two or even more. So that's a pretty nice solution. 
So you're saying I really do need MCP. Yeah, you do need MCP, but like you're showing here, 
you do also need A2A. So A2A for agents talking to agents and MCP for agents talking to tools and 
data. Yeah, it turns out we weren't competing.

We were complementing. Wow. Did you just make 
interoperability sound heartwarming? Hey, maybe I did.
